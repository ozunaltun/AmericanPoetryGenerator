The raven
Once upon a midnight dreary, while ı pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-
While ı nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping-rapping at my chamber door.
"'tis some visitor," ı muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-
Only this and nothing more."

Ah, distinctly ı remember, it was in the bleak december,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly ı wished the morrow;-vainly ı had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost lenore-
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore-
Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me-filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, ı stood repeating
"'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
This it is and nothing more."

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
"sir," said ı, "or madam, truly your forgiveness ı implore;
But the fact is ı was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping-tapping at my chamber door,
That ı scarce was sure ı heard you"-here ı opened wide the door:-
Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long ı stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "lenore!"
This ı whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "lenore!"
Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon ı heard again a tapping, somewhat louder than before.
"surely," said ı, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;-
'Tis the wind and nothing more."

Open here ı flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he: not an instant stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-
Perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door-
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
"though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," ı said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore-
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!"
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

Much ı marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door-
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as "nevermore."

But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered-not a feather then he fluttered-
Till ı scarcely more than muttered, "other friends have flown before-
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
Then the bird said, "nevermore."

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"doubtless," said ı, "what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-
Till the dirges of his hope the melancholy burden bore
Of 'never-nevermore.'"

But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight ı wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, ı betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking "nevermore."

This ı sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more ı sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
"wretch," ı cried, "thy god hath lent thee-by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite-respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost lenore!"
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

"prophet!" said ı, "thing of evil!-prophet still, if bird or devil!-
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-
On this home by horror haunted-tell me truly, ı implore-
Is there-is there balm in gilead?-tell me-tell me, ı implore!"
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

"prophet!" said ı, "thing of evil!-prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us - by that god we both adore-
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore -
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore."
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

"be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" ı shrieked, upstarting-
"get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!-quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted-nevermore!

The bells
I	hear the sledges with the bells-
Silver bells!
What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In their icy air of night!
While the stars, that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells-
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Iı	hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
Through the balmy air of night
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten golden-notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
How it swells!
How it dwells
On the future! How it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells, bells, bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells-
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
Iıı	hear the loud alarum bells-
Brazen bells!
What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells!
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now-now to sit or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
What a tale their terror tells
Of despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging,
And the clanging,
How the danger ebbs and flows;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,
In the jangling,
And the wrangling,
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells-
Of the bells-
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells-
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!
Iv	hear the tolling of the bells -
Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people-ah, the people-
They that dwell up in the steeple.
All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone-
They are neither man nor woman-
They are neither brute nor human -
They are ghouls:
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
Rolls
A paean from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the paean of the bells!
And he dances, and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of runic rhyme,
To the paean of the bells -
Of the bells:
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells -
Of the bells, bells, bells -
To the sobbing of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells-
Of the bells, bells, bells-
To the tolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells -
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells.

Ulalume
The skies they were ashen and sober;
The leaves they were crisped and sere-
The leaves they were withering and sere;
It was night in the lonesome october
Of my most immemorial year;
It was hard by the dim lake of auber,
In the misty mid region of weir-
It was down by the dank tarn of auber,
In the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir.

Here once, through an alley titanic.
Of cypress, ı roamed with my soul-
Of cypress, with psyche, my soul.
These were days when my heart was volcanic
As the scoriac rivers that roll-
As the lavas that restlessly roll
Their sulphurous currents down yaanek
In the ultimate climes of the pole-
That groan as they roll down mount yaanek
In the realms of the boreal pole.

Our talk had been serious and sober,
But our thoughts they were palsied and sere-
Our memories were treacherous and sere-
For we knew not the month was october,
And we marked not the night of the year-
(ah, night of all nights in the year!)
We noted not the dim lake of auber-
(though once we had journeyed down here)-
Remembered not the dank tarn of auber,
Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir.

And now as the night was senescent
And star-dials pointed to morn-
As the sun-dials hinted of morn-
At the end of our path a liquescent
And nebulous lustre was born,
Out of which a miraculous crescent
Arose with a duplicate horn-
Astarte's bediamonded crescent
Distinct with its duplicate horn.

And ı said-"she is warmer than dian:
She rolls through an ether of sighs-
She revels in a region of sighs:
She has seen that the tears are not dry on
These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
And has come past the stars of the lion
To point us the path to the skies-
To the lethean peace of the skies-
Come up, in despite of the lion,
To shine on us with her bright eyes-
Come up through the lair of the lion,
With love in her luminous eyes."

But psyche, uplifting her finger,
Said-"sadly this star ı mistrust-
Her pallor ı strangely mistrust:-
Oh, hasten!-oh, let us not linger!
Oh, fly!-let us fly!-for we must."
In terror she spoke, letting sink her
Wings till they trailed in the dust-
In agony sobbed, letting sink her
Plumes till they trailed in the dust-
Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

I replied-"this is nothing but dreaming:
Let us on by this tremulous light!
Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
Its sibyllic splendor is beaming
With hope and in beauty to-night:-
See!-it flickers up the sky through the night!
Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
And be sure it will lead us aright-
We safely may trust to a gleaming
That cannot but guide us aright,
Since it flickers up to heaven through the night."

Thus ı pacified psyche and kissed her,
And tempted her out of her gloom-
And conquered her scruples and gloom;
And we passed to the end of a vista,
But were stopped by the door of a tomb-
By the door of a legended tomb;
And ı said-"what is written, sweet sister,
On the door of this legended tomb?"
She replied-"ulalume-ulalume-
'Tis the vault of thy lost ulalume!"

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere-
As the leaves that were withering and sere;
And ı cried-"ıt was surely october
On this very night of last year
That ı journeyed-ı journeyed down here-
That ı brought a dread burden down here!
On this night of all nights in the year,
Ah, what demon has tempted me here?
Well ı know, now, this dim lake of auber-
This misty mid region of weir-
Well ı know, now, this dank tarn of auber,-
This ghoul-haunted woodland of weir."



Note

To helen
I saw thee once-once only-years ago:
I must not say how many-but not many.
It was a july midnight; and from out
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
With quietude, and sultriness and slumber,
Upon the upturn'd faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That gave out, in return for the love-light,
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.

Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
I saw thee half-reclining; while the moon
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,
And on thine own, upturn'd-alas, in sorrow!

Was it not fate, that, on this july midnight-
Was it not fate (whose name is also sorrow),
That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
No footstep stirred: the hated world all slept,
Save only thee and me-(o heaven!-o god!
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)-
Save only thee and me. I paused-ı looked-
And in an instant all things disappeared.
(ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)
The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
The happy flowers and the repining trees,
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
All-all expired save thee-save less than thou:
Save only the divine light in thine eyes-
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
I saw but them-they were the world to me.
I saw but them-saw only them for hours-
Saw only them until the moon went down.
What wild heart-histories seemed to lie unwritten
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
How dark a woe! Yet how sublime a hope!
How silently serene a sea of pride!
How daring an ambition! Yet how deep-
How fathomless a capacity for love!

But now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained.
They would not go-they never yet have gone.
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since.
They follow me-they lead me through the years.

They are my ministers-yet ı their slave.
Their office is to illumine and enkindle-
My duty, to be saved by their bright light,
And purified in their electric fire,
And sanctified in their elysian fire.
They fill my soul with beauty (which is hope),
And are far up in heaven-the stars ı kneel to
In the sad, silent watches of my night;
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still-two sweetly scintillant
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!

Annabel lee
It was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of annabel lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love-
I and my annabel lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful annabel lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me-
Yes!-that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my annabel lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we-
Of many far wiser than we-
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful annabel lee.

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful annabel lee;
And the stars never rise but ı see the bright eyes
Of the beautiful annabel lee;
And so, all the night-tide, ı lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea-
In her tomb by the side of the sea.

Note

A valentine
For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
Brightly expressive as the twins of leda,
Shall find her own sweet name, that, nestling lies
Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
Search narrowly the lines!-they hold a treasure
Divine-a talisman-an amulet
That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure-
The words-the syllables! Do not forget
The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor!
And yet there is in this no gordian knot
Which one might not undo without a sabre,
If one could merely comprehend the plot.
Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus
Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
Of poets by poets-as the name is a poet's, too.
Its letters, although naturally lying
Like the knight pinto-mendez ferdinando-
Still form a synonym for truth-cease trying!
You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do.


{to discover the names in this and the following poem, read the first letter of the first line in connection with the second letter of the second line, the third letter of the third line, the fourth, of the fourth and so on, to the end.}

An enigma
"seldom we find," says solomon don dunce,
"half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
Through all the flimsy things we see at once
As easily as through a naples bonnet-
Trash of all trash!-how can a lady don it?
Yet heavier far than your petrarchan stuff-
Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it."
And, veritably, sol is right enough.
The general tuckermanities are arrant
Bubbles-ephemeral and so transparent-
But this is, now-you may depend upon it-
Stable, opaque, immortal-all by dint
Of the dear names that lie concealed within't.
{see comment after previous poem.}
Note

To my mother
Because ı feel that, in the heavens above,
The angels, whispering to one another,
Can find, among their burning terms of love,
None so devotional as that of "mother,"
Therefore by that dear name ı long have called you-
You who are more than mother unto me,
And fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you,
In setting my virginia's spirit free.
My mother-my own mother, who died early,
Was but the mother of myself; but you
Are mother to the one ı loved so dearly,
And thus are dearer than the mother ı knew
By that infinity with which my wife
Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life.


{the above was addressed to the poet's mother-in-law, mrs. Clemm.-ed.}
Note

For annie
Thank heaven! The crisis-
The danger is past,
And the lingering illness
Is over at last-
And the fever called "living"
Is conquered at last.

Sadly, ı know,
I am shorn of my strength,
And no muscle ı move
As ı lie at full length-
But no matter!-ı feel
I am better at length.

And ı rest so composedly,
Now in my bed,
That any beholder
Might fancy me dead-
Might start at beholding me
Thinking me dead.

The moaning and groaning,
The sighing and sobbing,
Are quieted now,
With that horrible throbbing
At heart:-ah, that horrible,
Horrible throbbing!

The sickness-the nausea-
The pitiless pain-
Have ceased, with the fever
That maddened my brain-
With the fever called "living"
That burned in my brain.

And oh! Of all tortures
That torture the worst
Has abated-the terrible
Torture of thirst,
For the naphthaline river
Of passion accurst:-
I have drank of a water
That quenches all thirst:-

Of a water that flows,
With a lullaby sound,
From a spring but a very few
Feet under ground-
From a cavern not very far
Down under ground.

And ah! Let it never
Be foolishly said
That my room it is gloomy
And narrow my bed-
For man never slept
In a different bed;
And, to sleep, you must slumber
In just such a bed.

My tantalized spirit
Here blandly reposes,
Forgetting, or never
Regretting its roses-
Its old agitations
Of myrtles and roses:

For now, while so quietly
Lying, it fancies
A holier odor
About it, of pansies-
A rosemary odor,
Commingled with pansies-
With rue and the beautiful
Puritan pansies.

And so it lies happily,
Bathing in many
A dream of the truth
And the beauty of annie-
Drowned in a bath
Of the tresses of annie.

She tenderly kissed me,
She fondly caressed,
And then ı fell gently
To sleep on her breast-
Deeply to sleep
From the heaven of her breast.

When the light was extinguished,
She covered me warm,
And she prayed to the angels
To keep me from harm-
To the queen of the angels
To shield me from harm.

And ı lie so composedly,
Now in my bed
(knowing her love)
That you fancy me dead-
And ı rest so contentedly,
Now in my bed,
(with her love at my breast)
That you fancy me dead-
That you shudder to look at me.
Thinking me dead.

But my heart it is brighter
Than all of the many
Stars in the sky,
For it sparkles with annie-
It glows with the light
Of the love of my annie-
With the thought of the light
Of the eyes of my annie.

Note

To f--
Beloved! Amid the earnest woes
That crowd around my earthly path-
(drear path, alas! Where grows
Not even one lonely rose)-
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee, and therein knows
An eden of bland repose.

And thus thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted far-off isle
In some tumultuous sea-
Some ocean throbbing far and free
With storm-but where meanwhile
Serenest skies continually
Just o'er that one bright inland smile.

Note

To frances s. Osgood
Thou wouldst be loved?-then let thy heart
From its present pathway part not;
Being everything which now thou art,
Be nothing which thou art not.
So with the world thy gentle ways,
Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
Shall be an endless theme of praise.
And love a simple duty.

Note

Eldorado
Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of eldorado.
But he grew old-
This knight so bold-
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like eldorado.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow-
"shadow," said he,
"where can it be-
This land of eldorado?"

"over the mountains
Of the moon,
Down the valley of the shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,"
The shade replied,
"ıf you seek for eldorado!"

Note

Eulalie
I dwelt alone
In a world of moan,
And my soul was a stagnant tide,
Till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride-
Till the yellow-haired young eulalie became my smiling bride.
Ah, less-less bright
The stars of the night
Than the eyes of the radiant girl!
And never a flake
That the vapor can make
With the moon-tints of purple and pearl,
Can vie with the modest eulalie's most unregarded curl-
Can compare with the bright-eyed eulalie's most humble and careless curl.
Now doubt-now pain
Come never again,
For her soul gives me sigh for sigh,
And all day long
Shines, bright and strong,
Astarte within the sky,
While ever to her dear eulalie upturns her matron eye-
While ever to her young eulalie upturns her violet eye.

Note

A dream within a dream
Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream:
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And ı hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! Yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep
While ı weep-while ı weep!
O god! Can ı not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O god! Can ı not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?

Note

Marie louise (shew)
Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
The blotting utterly from out high heaven
The sacred sun-of all who, weeping, bless thee
Hourly for hope-for life-ah, above all,
For the resurrection of deep buried faith
In truth, in virtue, in humanity-
Of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed
Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
At thy soft-murmured words, "let there be light!"
At thy soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
In thy seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
Of all who owe thee most, whose gratitude
Nearest resembles worship,-oh, remember
The truest, the most fervently devoted,
And think that these weak lines are written by him-
By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
His spirit is communing with an angel's.

Note

() to marie louise (shew)
Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
In the mad pride of intellectuality,
Maintained "the power of words"-denied that ever
A thought arose within the human brain
Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
Two words-two foreign soft dissyllables-
Italian tones, made only to be murmured
By angels dreaming in the moonlit "dew
That hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,"-
Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
Than even the seraph harper, ısrafel,
(who has "the sweetest voice of all god's creatures,")
Could hope to utter. And ı! My spells are broken.
The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
With thy dear name as text, though hidden by thee,
I cannot write-ı cannot speak or think-
Alas, ı cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
This standing motionless upon the golden
Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,
Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
And thrilling as ı see, upon the right,
Upon the left, and all the way along,
Amid empurpled vapors, far away
To where the prospect terminates-thee only!

Note

The city in the sea
Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city lying alone
Far down within the dim west,
Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
Have gone to their eternal rest.
There shrines and palaces and towers
(time-eaten towers and tremble not!)
Resemble nothing that is ours.
Around, by lifting winds forgot,
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.

No rays from the holy heaven come down
On the long night-time of that town;
But light from out the lurid sea
Streams up the turrets silently-
Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-
Up domes-up spires-up kingly halls-
Up fanes-up babylon-like walls-
Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-
Up many and many a marvellous shrine
Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
The viol, the violet, and the vine.

Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie.
So blend the turrets and shadows there
That all seem pendulous in air,
While from a proud tower in the town
Death looks gigantically down.

There open fanes and gaping graves
Yawn level with the luminous waves;
But not the riches there that lie
In each idol's diamond eye-
Not the gaily-jewelled dead
Tempt the waters from their bed;
For no ripples curl, alas!
Along that wilderness of glass-
No swellings tell that winds may be
Upon some far-off happier sea-
No heavings hint that winds have been
On seas less hideously serene.

But lo, a stir is in the air!
The wave-there is a movement there!
As if the towers had thrust aside,
In slightly sinking, the dull tide-
As if their tops had feebly given
A void within the filmy heaven.
The waves have now a redder glow-
The hours are breathing faint and low-
And when, amid no earthly moans,
Down, down that town shall settle hence,
Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
Shall do it reverence.

The sleeper
At midnight, in the month of june,
I stand beneath the mystic moon.
An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
Upon the quiet mountain top,
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the universal valley.
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest;
Looking like lethe, see! The lake
A conscious slumber seems to take,
And would not, for the world, awake.
All beauty sleeps!-and lo! Where lies
(her casement open to the skies)
Irene, with her destinies!

Oh, lady bright! Can it be right-
This window open to the night!
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice-drop-
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully-so fearfully-
Above the closed and fringed lid
'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,
That, o'er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! Strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all-solemn silentness!

The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to god that she may lie
For ever with unopened eye,
While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!

My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep;
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold-
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And winged panels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,
Of her grand family funerals-
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portal she hath thrown,
In childhood many an idle stone-
Some tomb from out whose sounding door
She ne'er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
It was the dead who groaned within.

Bridal ballad
The ring is on my hand,
And the wreath is on my brow;
Satins and jewels grand
Are all at my command.
And ı am happy now.

And my lord he loves me well;
But, when first he breathed his vow,
I felt my bosom swell-
For the words rang as a knell,
And the voice seemed his who fell
In the battle down the dell,
And who is happy now.

But he spoke to reassure me,
And he kissed my pallid brow,
While a reverie came o'er me,
And to the churchyard bore me,
And ı sighed to him before me,
Thinking him dead d'elormie,
"oh, ı am happy now!"

And thus the words were spoken,
And thus the plighted vow,
And, though my faith be broken,
And, though my heart be broken,
Behold the golden keys
That proves me happy now!

Would to god ı could awaken
For ı dream ı 

"wretches! Ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her-that she died!
How shall the ritual, then, be read?-the requiem how be sung
By you-by yours, the evil eye,-by yours, the slanderous tongue
That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?"

Peccavimus; but rave not thus! And let a sabbath song
Go up to god so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong!
The sweet lenore hath "gone before," with hope, that flew beside,
Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride-
For her, the fair and debonnaire, that now so lowly lies,
The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes-
The life still there, upon her hair-the death upon her eyes.

"avaunt! To-night my heart is light. No dirge will ı upraise,
But waft the angel on her flight with a paean of old days!
Let no bell toll!-lest her sweet soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
Should catch the note, as it doth float up from the damned earth.
To friends above, from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-
From hell unto a high estate far up within the heaven-
From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the king of heaven."


Note

To one in paradise
Thou wast that all to me, love,
For which my soul did pine-
A green isle in the sea, love,
A fountain and a shrine,
All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
And all the flowers were mine.

Ah, dream too bright to last!
Ah, starry hope! That didst arise
But to be overcast!
A voice from out the future cries,
"on! On!"-but o'er the past
(dim gulf!) My spirit hovering lies
Mute, motionless, aghast!

For, alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is o'er!
"no more-no more-no more"-
(such language holds the solemn sea
To the sands upon the shore)
Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree,
Or the stricken eagle soar!

And all my days are trances,
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances,
And where thy footstep gleams-
In what ethereal dances,
By what eternal streams!

Alas! For that accursed time
They bore thee o'er the billow,
From love to titled age and crime,
And an unholy pillow!
From me, and from our misty clime,
Where weeps the silver willow!


Note

The coliseum
Type of the antique rome! Rich reliquary
Of lofty contemplation left to time
By buried centuries of pomp and power!
At length-at length-after so many days
Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
(thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

Vastness! And age! And memories of eld!
Silence! And desolation! And dim night!
I feel ye now-ı feel ye in your strength-
O spells more sure than e'er judaean king
Taught in the gardens of gethsemane!
O charms more potent than the rapt chaldee
Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
Here, where the dames of rome their gilded hair
Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

But stay! These walls-these ivy-clad arcades-
These mouldering plinths-these sad and blackened shafts-
These vague entablatures-this crumbling frieze-
These shattered cornices-this wreck-this ruin-
These stones-alas! These gray stones-are they all-
All of the famed, and the colossal left
By the corrosive hours to fate and me?

"not all"-the echoes answer me-"not all!
Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
From us, and from all ruin, unto the wise,
As melody from memnon to the sun.
We rule the hearts of mightiest men-we rule
With a despotic sway all giant minds.
We are not impotent-we pallid stones.
Not all our power is gone-not all our fame-
Not all the magic of our high renown-
Not all the wonder that encircles us-
Not all the mysteries that in us lie-
Not all the memories that hang upon
And cling around about us as a garment,
Clothing us in a robe of more than glory."


Note

The haunted palace
In the greenest of our valleys
By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace-
Radiant palace-reared its head.
In the monarch thought's dominion-
It stood there!
Never seraph spread a pinion
Over fabric half so fair!

Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
On its roof did float and flow,
(this-all this-was in the olden
Time long ago),
And every gentle air that dallied,
In that sweet day,
Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
A winged odor went away.

Wanderers in that happy valley,
Through two luminous windows, saw
Spirits moving musically,
To a lute's well-tuned law,
Bound about a throne where, sitting
(porphyrogene!)
In state his glory well befitting,
The ruler of the realm was seen.

And all with pearl and ruby glowing
Was the fair palace door,
Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
And sparkling evermore,
A troop of echoes, whose sweet duty
Was but to sing,
In voices of surpassing beauty,
The wit and wisdom of their king.

But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
Assailed the monarch's high estate.
(ah, let us mourn!-for never morrow
Shall dawn upon him desolate !)
And round about his home the glory
That blushed and bloomed,
Is but a dim-remembered story
Of the old time entombed.

And travellers, now, within that valley,
Through the red-litten windows see
Vast forms, that move fantastically
To a discordant melody,
While, like a ghastly rapid river,
Through the pale door
A hideous throng rush out forever
And laugh-but smile no more.


Note

The conqueror worm
Lo! 'Tis a gala night
Within the lonesome latter years!
An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
In veils, and drowned in tears,
Sit in a theatre, to see
A play of hopes and fears,
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres.

Mimes, in the form of god on high,
Mutter and mumble low,
And hither and thither fly-
Mere puppets they, who come and go
At bidding of vast formless things
That shift the scenery to and fro,
Flapping from out their condor wings
Invisible wo!

That motley drama-oh, be sure
It shall not be forgot!
With its phantom chased for evermore,
By a crowd that seize it not,
Through a circle that ever returneth in
To the self-same spot,
And much of madness, and more of sin,
And horror the soul of the plot.

But see, amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude!
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes!-it writhes!-with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food,
And the angels sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.

Out-out are the lights-out all!
And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm,
And the angels, all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy, "man,"
And its hero the conqueror worm.


Note

Silence
There are some qualities-some incorporate things,
That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a twofold silence-sea and shore-
Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's "no more."
He is the corporate silence: dread him not!
No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man), commend thyself to god!


Note

Dreamland
By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an eidolon, named night,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim thule-
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime,
Out of space-out of time.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the dews that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters-lone and dead,
Their still waters-still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,-
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,-

By the mountains-near the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,-
By the gray woods,-by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp,-
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the ghouls,-
By each spot the most unholy-
In each nook most melancholy,-

There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted memories of the past-
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by-
White-robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the earth-and heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region-
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis-oh, 'tis an eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May not-dare not openly view it;
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its king, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only.
Where an eidolon, named night,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim thule.


Note

To zante
Fair isle, that from the fairest of all flowers,
Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take!
How many memories of what radiant hours
At sight of thee and thine at once awake!
How many scenes of what departed bliss!
How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
How many visions of a maiden that is
No more-no more upon thy verdant slopes!

No more! Alas, that magical sad sound
Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more-
Thy memory no more! Accursed ground
Henceforward ı hold thy flower-enamelled shore,
O hyacinthine isle! O purple zante!
"ısola d'oro! Fior di levante!"

Hymn
At morn-at noon-at twilight dim-
Maria! Thou hast heard my hymn!
In joy and wo-in good and ill-
Mother of god, be with me still!
When the hours flew brightly by,
And not a cloud obscured the sky,
My soul, lest it should truant be,
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee
Now, when storms of fate o'ercast
Darkly my present and my past,
.

Scenes from politian
An unpublished drama
I

Rome - a hall in a palace. Alessandra and castıglıone.

Alessandra	thou art sad, castiglione.
Castiglione	sad!-not ı.
Oh, ı'm the happiest, happiest man in rome!
A few days more, thou knowest, my alessandra,
Will make thee mine. Oh, ı am very happy!
Alessandra	methinks thou hast a singular way of showing
Thy happiness-what ails thee, cousin of mine?
Why didst thou sigh so deeply?
Castiglione	did ı sigh?
I was not conscious of it. It is a fashion,
A silly-a most silly fashion ı have
When ı am very happy. Did ı sigh? [sighing]
Alessandra	thou didst. Thou art not well. Thou hast indulged
Too much of late, and ı am vexed to see it.
Late hours and wine, castiglione,-these
Will ruin thee! Thou art already altered-
Thy looks are haggard-nothing so wears away
The constitution as late hours and wine.
Castiglione (musing)	nothing, fair cousin, nothing-
Not even deep sorrow-
Wears it away like evil hours and wine.
I will amend.
Alessandra	do it! I would have thee drop
Thy riotous company, too-fellows low born
Ill suit the like of old di broglio's heir
And alessandra's husband.
Castiglione	ı will drop them.
Alessandra	thou wilt-thou must. Attend thou also more
To thy dress and equipage-they are over plain
For thy lofty rank and fashion-much depends
Upon appearances.
Castiglione	ı'll see to it.
Alessandra	then see to it!-pay more attention, sir,
To a becoming carriage-much thou wantest
In dignity.
Castiglione	much, much, oh, much ı want
In proper dignity.
Alessandra (haughtily)	thou mockest me, sir!
Castiglione (abstractedly)	sweet, gentle lalage!
Alessandra	heard ı aright?
I speak to him-he speaks of lalage?
Sir count!
[places her hand on his shoulder]
What art thou dreaming?
He's not well!
What ails thee, sir?
Castiglione (starting)	cousin! Fair cousin!-madam!
I crave thy pardon-indeed ı am not well-
Your hand from off my shoulder, if you please.
This air is most oppressive!-madam-the duke!
Enter di broglio
Di broglio	my son, ı've news for thee!-hey!-what's the matter?
[observing alessandra].
I' the pouts? Kiss her, castiglione! Kiss her,
You dog! And make it up, ı say, this minute!
I've news for you both. Politian is expected
Hourly in rome-politian, earl of leicester!
We'll have him at the wedding. 'Tis his first visit
To the imperial city.
Alessandra	what! Politian
Of britain, earl of leicester?
Di broglio	the same, my love.
We'll have him at the wedding. A man quite young
In years, but gray in fame. I have not seen him,
But rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy
Pre-eminent in arts, and arms, and wealth,
And high descent. We'll have him at the wedding.
Alessandra	ı have heard much of this politian.
Gay, volatile and giddy-is he not,
And little given to thinking?
Di broglio	far from it, love.
No branch, they say, of all philosophy
So deep abstruse he has not mastered it.
Learned as few are learned.
Alessandra	'tis very strange!
I have known men have seen politian
And sought his company. They speak of him
As of one who entered madly into life,
Drinking the cup of pleasure to the dregs.
Castiglione	ridiculous! Now ı have seen politian
And know him well-nor learned nor mirthful he.
He is a dreamer, and shut out
From common passions.
Di broglio	children, we disagree.
Let us go forth and taste the fragrant air
Of the garden. Did ı dream, or did ı hear
Politian was a melancholy man?
[exeunt]

Rome.-a lady's apartment, with a window open and looking into a garden. Lalage, in deep mourning, reading at a table on which lie some books and a hand-mirror. In the background jacınta (a servant maid) leans carelessly upon a chair.
Lalage	jacinta! İs it thou?
Jacinta (pertly)	yes, ma'am, ı'm here.
Lalage	ı did not know, jacinta, you were in waiting.
Sit down!-let not my presence trouble you-
Sit down!-for ı am humble, most humble.
Jacinta (aside)	'tis time.
(jacinta seats herself in a side-long manner upon the chair, resting her elbows upon the back, and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look. Lalage continues to read.)
Lalage	"ıt in another climate, so he said,
Bore a bright golden flower, but not i' this soil!"
[pauses-turns over some leaves and resumes.]
"no lingering winters there, nor snow, nor shower-
But ocean ever to refresh mankind
Breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind"
Oh, beautiful!-most beautiful!-how like
To what my fevered soul doth dream of heaven!
O happy land! [pauses] she died!-the maiden died!
O still more happy maiden who couldst die!
Jacinta!
[jacinta returns no answer, and lalage presently resumes,]
Again!-a similar tale
Told of a beauteous dame beyond the sea!
Thus speaketh one ferdinand in the words of the play-
"she died full young"-one bossola answers him-
"ı think not so-her infelicity
Seemed to have years too many"-ah, luckless lady!
Jacinta! [still no answer.]
Here's a far sterner story-
But like-oh, very like in its despair-
Of that egyptian queen, winning so easily
A thousand hearts-losing at length her own.
She died. Thus endeth the history-and her maids
Lean over her and keep-two gentle maids
With gentle names-eiros and charmion!
Rainbow and dove!-jacinta!
Jacinta (pettishly)	madam, what is it?
Lalage	wilt thou, my good jacinta, be so kind
As go down in the library and bring me
The holy evangelists?
Jacinta	pshaw!
[exit]
Lalage	ıf there be balm
For the wounded spirit in gilead, it is there!
Dew in the night time of my bitter trouble
Will there be found-"dew sweeter far than that
Which hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill."
[re-enter jacinta, and throws a volume on the table]
Jacinta
(aside)	there, ma'am, 's the book.
Indeed she is very troublesome.
Lalage (astonished)	what didst thou say, jacinta?
Have ı done aught
To grieve thee or to vex thee?-ı am sorry.
For thou hast served me long and ever been
Trustworthy and respectful.
[resumes her reading.]
Jacinta (aside)	ı can't believe
She has any more jewels-no-no-she gave me all.
Lalage	what didst thou say, jacinta? Now ı bethink me
Thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding.
How fares good ugo?-and when is it to be?
Can ı do aught?-is there no further aid
Thou needest, jacinta?
Jacinta (aside)	ıs there no further aid!
That's meant for me.
[aloud]
I'm sure, madam, you need not
Be always throwing those jewels in my teeth.
Lalage	jewels! Jacinta,-now indeed, jacinta, ı thought not of the jewels.
Jacinta	oh, perhaps not!
But then ı might have sworn it. After all,
There's ugo says the ring is only paste,
For he's sure the count castiglione never
Would have given a real diamond to such as you;
And at the best ı'm certain, madam, you cannot
Have use for jewels now. But ı might have sworn it.
[exit]
[lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table-after a short pause raises it.]
Lalage	poor lalage!-and is it come to this?
Thy servant maid!-but courage!-'tis but a viper
Whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul!
[taking up the mirror]
Ha! Here at least's a friend-too much a friend
In earlier days-a friend will not deceive thee.
Fair mirror and true! Now tell me (for thou canst)
A tale-a pretty tale-and heed thou not
Though it be rife with woe. It answers me.
It speaks of sunken eyes, and wasted cheeks,
And beauty long deceased-remembers me,
Of joy departed-hope, the seraph hope,
Inurned and entombed!-now, in a tone
Low, sad, and solemn, but most audible,
Whispers of early grave untimely yawning
For ruined maid. Fair mirror and true!-thou liest not!
Thou hast no end to gain-no heart to break-
Castiglione lied who said he loved--
Thou true-he false!-false!-false!
[while she speaks, a monk enters her apartment and approaches unobserved.]
Monk	refuge thou hast,
Sweet daughter! İn heaven. Think of eternal things!
Give up thy soul to penitence, and pray!
Lalage (arising hurriedly)	ı cannot pray!-my soul is at war with god!
The frightful sounds of merriment below;
Disturb my senses-go! I cannot pray-
The sweet airs from the garden worry me!
Thy presence grieves me-go!-thy priestly raiment
Fills me with dread-thy ebony crucifix
With horror and awe!
Monk	think of thy precious soul!
Lalage	think of my early days!-think of my father
And mother in heaven! Think of our quiet home,
And the rivulet that ran before the door!
Think of my little sisters!-think of them!
And think of me!-think of my trusting love
And confidence-his vows-my ruin-think-think
Of my unspeakable misery!--begone!
Yet stay! Yet stay!-what was it thou saidst of prayer
And penitence? Didst thou not speak of faith
And vows before the throne?
Monk	ı did.
Lalage	'tis well.
There is a vow 'twere fitting should be made-
A sacred vow, imperative and urgent,
A solemn vow!
Monk	daughter, this zeal is well!
Lalage	father, this zeal is anything but well!
Hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing?
A crucifix whereon to register
This sacred vow? [he hands her his own.]
Not that-oh! No!-no!-no [shuddering.]
Not that! Not that!-ı tell thee, holy man,
Thy raiments and thy ebony cross affright me!
Stand back! I have a crucifix myself,-
I have a crucifix! Methinks 'twere fitting
The deed-the vow-the symbol of the deed-
And the deed's register should tally, father!
[draws a cross-handled dagger and raises it on high.]
Behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine
Is written in heaven!
Monk	thy words are madness, daughter,
And speak a purpose unholy-thy lips are livid-
Thine eyes are wild-tempt not the wrath divine!
Pause ere too late!-oh, be not-be not rash!
Swear not the oath-oh, swear it not!
Lalage	'tis sworn!

An apartment in a palace. Polıtıan and baldazzar.
Baldazzar	arouse thee now, politian!
Thou must not-nay indeed, indeed, thou shalt not
Give way unto these humors. Be thyself!
Shake off the idle fancies that beset thee
And live, for now thou diest!
Politian	not so, baldazzar!
Surely ı live!
Baldazzar	politian, it doth grieve me
To see thee thus!
Politian	baldazzar, it doth grieve me
To give thee cause for grief, my honored friend.
Command me, sir! What wouldst thou have me do?
At thy behest ı will shake off that nature
Which from my forefathers ı did inherit,
Which with my mother's milk ı did imbibe,
And be no more politian, but some other.
Command me, sir!
Baldazzar	to the field then-to the field-
To the senate or the field.
Politian	alas! Alas!
There is an imp would follow me even there!
There is an imp hath followed me even there!
There is-what voice was that?
Baldazzar	ı heard it not.
I heard not any voice except thine own,
And the echo of thine own.
Politian	then ı but dreamed.
Baldazzar	give not thy soul to dreams: the camp-the court
Befit thee-fame awaits thee-glory calls-
And her the trumpet-tongued thou wilt not hear
In hearkening to imaginary sounds
And phantom voices.
Politian	ıt is a phantom voice!
Didst thou not hear it then?
Baldazzar	ı heard it not.
Politian	thou heardst it not!-baldazzar, speak no more
To me, politian, of thy camps and courts.
Oh! I am sick, sick, sick, even unto death,
Of the hollow and high-sounding vanities
Of the populous earth! Bear with me yet awhile
We have been boys together-school-fellows-
And now are friends-yet shall not be so long-
For in the eternal city thou shalt do me
A kind and gentle office, and a power-
A power august, benignant, and supreme-
Shall then absolve thee of all further duties
Unto thy friend.
Baldazzar	thou speakest a fearful riddle
I will not understand.
Politian	yet now as fate
Approaches, and the hours are breathing low,
The sands of time are changed to golden grains,
And dazzle me, baldazzar. Alas! Alas!
I cannot die, having within my heart
So keen a relish for the beautiful
As hath been kindled within it. Methinks the air
Is balmier now than it was wont to be-
Rich melodies are floating in the winds-
A rarer loveliness bedecks the earth-
And with a holier lustre the quiet moon
Sitteth in heaven.-hist! Hist! Thou canst not say
Thou hearest not now, baldazzar?
Baldazzar	ındeed ı hear not.
Politian	not hear it!-listen-now-listen!-the faintest sound
And yet the sweetest that ear ever heard!
A lady's voice!-and sorrow in the tone!
Baldazzar, it oppresses me like a spell!
Again!-again!-how solemnly it falls
Into my heart of hearts! That eloquent voice
Surely ı never heard-yet it were well
Had ı but heard it with its thrilling tones
In earlier days!
Baldazzar	ı myself hear it now.
Be still!-the voice, if ı mistake not greatly,
Proceeds from younder lattice-which you may see
Very plainly through the window-it belongs,
Does it not? Unto this palace of the duke.
The singer is undoubtedly beneath
The roof of his excellency-and perhaps
Is even that alessandra of whom he spoke
As the betrothed of castiglione,
His son and heir.
Politian	be still!-it comes again!
Voice (very faintly)	"and is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus,
That have loved thee so long,
In wealth and woe among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say nay! Say nay!"
Baldazzar	the song is english, and ı oft have heard it
In merry england-never so plaintively-
Hist! Hist! İt comes again!
Voice (more loudly)	"ıs it so strong
As for to leave me thus,
That have loved thee so long,
In wealth and woe among?
And is thy heart so strong
As for to leave me thus?
Say nay! Say nay!"
Baldazzar	'tis hushed and all is still!
Politian	all is not still.
Baldazzar	let us go down.
Politian	go down, baldazzar, go!
Baldazzar	the hour is growing late-the duke awaits us,-
Thy presence is expected in the hall
Below. What ails thee, earl politian?
Voice (distinctly)	"who have loved thee so long,
In wealth and woe among,
And is thy heart so strong?
Say nay! Say nay!"
Baldazzar	let us descend!-'tis time. Politian, give
These fancies to the wind. Remember, pray,
Your bearing lately savored much of rudeness
Unto the duke. Arouse thee! And remember!
Politian	remember? I do. Lead on! I do remember.[going].
Let us descend. Believe me ı would give,
Freely would give the broad lands of my earldom
To look upon the face hidden by yon lattice-
"to gaze upon that veiled face, and hear
Once more that silent tongue."
Baldazzar	let me beg you, sir,
Descend with me-the duke may be offended.
Let us go down, ı pray you.
Voice (loudly)	say nay!-say nay!
Politian (aside)	'tis strange!-'tis very strange-methought the voice
Chimed in with my desires and bade me stay!
[approaching the window]
Sweet voice! I heed thee, and will surely stay.
Now be this fancy, by heaven, or be it fate,
Still will ı not descend. Baldazzar, make
Apology unto the duke for me;
I go not down to-night.
Baldazzar	your lordship's pleasure
Shall be attended to. Good-night, politian.
Politian	good-night, my friend, good-night.
Iv

The gardens of a palace-moonlight. Lalage and polıtıan.
Lalage	and dost thou speak of love
To me, politian?-dost thou speak of love
To lalage?-ah woe-ah woe is me!
This mockery is most cruel-most cruel indeed!
Politian	weep not! Oh, sob not thus!-thy bitter tears
Will madden me. Oh, mourn not, lalage-
Be comforted! I know-ı know it all,
And still ı speak of love. Look at me, brightest,
And beautiful lalage!-turn here thine eyes!
Thou askest me if ı could speak of love,
Knowing what ı know, and seeing what ı have seen
Thou askest me that-and thus ı answer thee-
Thus on my bended knee ı answer thee. [kneeling]
Sweet lalage, ı love thee-love thee-love thee;
Thro' good and ill-thro' weal and woe, ı love thee.
Not mother, with her first-born on her knee,
Thrills with intenser love than ı for thee.
Not on god's altar, in any time or clime,
Burned there a holier fire than burneth now
Within my spirit for thee. And do ı love?
[arising]
Even for thy woes ı love thee-even for thy woes-
Thy beauty and thy woes.
Lalage	alas, proud earl,
Thou dost forget thyself, remembering me!
How, in thy father's halls, among the maidens
Pure and reproachless of thy princely line,
Could the dishonored lalage abide?
Thy wife, and with a tainted memory-
My seared and blighted name, how would it tally
With the ancestral honors of thy house,
And with thy glory?
Politian	speak not to me of glory!
I hate-ı loathe the name; ı do abhor
The unsatisfactory and ideal thing.
Art thou not lalage, and ı politian?
Do ı not love-art thou not beautiful-
What need we more? Ha! Glory! Now speak not of it:
By all ı hold most sacred and most solemn-
By all my wishes now-my fears hereafter-
By all ı scorn on earth and hope in heaven-
There is no deed ı would more glory in,
Than in thy cause to scoff at this same glory
And trample it under foot. What matters it-
What matters it, my fairest, and my best,
That we go down unhonored and forgotten
Into the dust-so we descend together?
Descend together-and then-and then perchance-
Lalage	why dost thou pause, politian?
Politian	and then perchance
Arise together, lalage, and roam
The starry and quiet dwellings of the blest,
And still-
Lalage	why dost thou pause, politian?
Politian	and still together-together.
Lalage	now, earl of leicester!
Thou lovest me, and in my heart of hearts
I feel thou lovest me truly.
Politian	o lalage!
[throwing himself upon his knee.]
And lovest thou me?
Lalage	hist! Hush! Within the gloom
Of yonder trees methought a figure passed-
A spectral figure, solemn, and slow, and noiseless-
Like the grim shadow conscience, solemn and noiseless.
[walks across and returns]
I was mistaken-'twas but a giant bough
Stirred by the autumn wind. Politian!
Politian	my lalage-my love! Why art thou moved?
Why dost thou turn so pale? Not conscience self,
Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it,
Should shake the firm spirit thus. But the night wind
Is chilly-and these melancholy boughs
Throw over all things a gloom.
Lalage	politian!
Thou speakest to me of love. Knowest thou the land
With which all tongues are busy-a land new found-
Miraculously found by one of genoa-
A thousand leagues within the golden west?
A fairy land of flowers, and fruit, and sunshine,-
And crystal lakes, and over-arching forests,
And mountains, around whose towering summits the winds
Of heaven untrammelled flow-which air to breathe
Is happiness now, and will be freedom hereafter
In days that are to come?
Politian	oh, wilt thou-wilt thou
Fly to that paradise-my lalage, wilt thou
Fly thither with me? There care shall be forgotten,
And sorrow shall be no more, and eros be all.
And life shall then be mine, for ı will live
For thee, and in thine eyes-and thou shalt be
No more a mourner-but the radiant joys
Shall wait upon thee, and the angel hope
Attend thee ever; and ı will kneel to thee
And worship thee, and call thee my beloved,
My own, my beautiful, my love, my wife,
My all;-oh, wilt thou-wilt thou, lalage,
Fly thither with me?
Lalage	a deed is to be done-
Castiglione lives!
Politian	and he shall die!
[exit]
Lalage (after a pause)	and-he-shall-die!-alas!
Castiglione die? Who spoke the words?
Where am ı?-what was it he said?-politian!
Thou art not gone-thou art not gone, politian!
I feel thou art not gone-yet dare not look,
Lest ı behold thee not-thou couldst not go
With those words upon thy lips-oh, speak to me!
And let me hear thy voice-one word-one word,
To say thou art not gone,-one little sentence,
To say how thou dost scorn-how thou dost hate
My womanly weakness. Ha! Ha! Thou art not gone-
Oh, speak to me! I knew thou wouldst not go!
I knew thou wouldst not, couldst not, durst not go.
Villain, thou art not gone-thou mockest me!
And thus ı clutch thee-thus!-he is gone, he is gone-
Gone-gone. Where am ı?-'tis well-'tis very well!
So that the blade be keen-the blow be sure,
'Tis well, 'tis very well-alas! Alas!
V

The suburbs. Polıtıan alone.
Politian	this weakness grows upon me. I am fain
And much ı fear me ill-it will not do
To die ere ı have lived!-stay-stay thy hand,
O azrael, yet awhile!-prince of the powers
Of darkness and the tomb, oh, pity me!
Oh, pity me! Let me not perish now,
In the budding of my paradisal hope!
Give me to live yet-yet a little while:
'Tis ı who pray for life-ı who so late
Demanded but to die!-what sayeth the count?
[enter baldazzar]
Baldazzar	that, knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud
Between the earl politian and himself,
He doth decline your cartel.
Politian	what didst thou say?
What answer was it you brought me, good baldazzar?
With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes
Laden from yonder bowers!-a fairer day,
Or one more worthy ıtaly, methinks
No mortal eyes have seen!-what said the count?
Baldazzar	that he, castiglione, not being aware
Of any feud existing, or any cause
Of quarrel between your lordship and himself,
Cannot accept the challenge.
Politian	ıt is most true-
All this is very true. When saw you, sir,
When saw you now, baldazzar, in the frigid
Ungenial britain which we left so lately,
A heaven so calm as this-so utterly free
From the evil taint of clouds?-and he did say?
Baldazzar	no more, my lord, than ı have told you:
The count castiglione will not fight.
Having no cause for quarrel.
Politian	now this is true-
All very true. Thou art my friend, baldazzar,
And ı have not forgotten it-thou'lt do me
A piece of service: wilt thou go back and say
Unto this man, that ı, the earl of leicester,
Hold him a villain?-thus much, ı pr'ythee, say
Unto the count-it is exceeding just
He should have cause for quarrel.
Baldazzar	my lord!-my friend!-
Politian (aside)	'tis he-he comes himself!
[aloud] thou reasonest well.
I know what thou wouldst say-not send the message-
Well!-ı will think of it-ı will not send it.
Now pr'ythee, leave me-hither doth come a person
With whom affairs of a most private nature
I would adjust.
Baldazzar	ı go-to-morrow we meet,
Do we not?-at the vatican.
Politian	at the vatican.
[exit baldazzar]
[enter castiglione]
Castiglione	the earl of leicester here!
Politian	ı am the earl of leicester, and thou seest,
Dost thou not, that ı am here?
Castiglione	my lord, some strange,
Some singular mistake-misunderstanding-
Hath without doubt arisen: thou hast been urged
Thereby, in heat of anger, to address
Some words most unaccountable, in writing,
To me, castiglione; the bearer being
Baldazzar, duke of surrey. I am aware
Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing,
Having given thee no offence. Ha!-am ı right?
'Twas a mistake?-undoubtedly-we all
Do err at times.
Politian	draw, villain, and prate no more!
Castiglione	ha!-draw?-and villain? Have at thee then at once,
Proud earl!
[draws.]
Politian	thus to the expiatory tomb,
Untimely sepulchre, ı do devote thee
In the name of lalage!
Castiglione
(letting fall his sword and recoiling
To the extremity of the stage)	of lalage!
Hold off-thy sacred hand!-avaunt, ı say!
Avaunt-ı will not fight thee-indeed ı dare not.
Politian	thou wilt not fight with me didst say, sir count?
Shall ı be baffled thus?-now this is well;
Didst say thou darest not? Ha!
Castiglione	ı dare not-dare not-
Hold off thy hand-with that beloved name
So fresh upon thy lips ı will not fight thee-
I cannot-dare not.
Politian	now, by my halidom,
I do believe thee!-coward, ı do believe thee!
Castiglione	ha!-coward!-this may not be!
[clutches his sword and staggers towards politian, but his purpose is changed before reaching him, and he falls upon his knee at the feet of the earl]
Alas! My lord,
It is-it is-most true. In such a cause
I am the veriest coward. Oh, pity me!
Politian (greatly softened)	alas!-ı do-indeed ı pity thee.
Castiglione	and lalage-
Politian	scoundrel!-arise and die!
Castiglione	ıt needeth not be-thus-thus-oh, let me die
Thus on my bended knee. It were most fitting
That in this deep humiliation ı perish.
For in the fight ı will not raise a hand
Against thee, earl of leicester. Strike thou home-
[baring his bosom]
Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon-
Strike home. I will not fight thee.
Politian	now's death and hell!
Am ı not-am ı not sorely-grievously tempted
To take thee at thy word? But mark me, sir:
Think not to fly me thus. Do thou prepare
For public insult in the streets-before
The eyes of the citizens. I'll follow thee-
Like an avenging spirit ı'll follow thee
Even unto death. Before those whom thou lovest-
Before all rome ı'll taunt thee, villain,-ı'll taunt thee,
Dost hear? With cowardice-thou wilt not fight me?
Thou liest! Thou shalt!
[exit]
Castiglione	now this indeed is just!
Most righteous, and most just, avenging heaven!

Note on politian
Such portions of "politian" as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the southern literary messenger for december and january , being styled "scenes from politian; an unpublished drama." these scenes were included, unaltered, in the collection of poems by poe. The larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor, but it is not considered just to the poet's memory to publish it. The work is a hasty and unrevised production of its author's earlier days of literary labor; and, beyond the scenes already known, scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation. As a specimen, however, of the parts unpublished, the following fragment from the first scene of act ıı. May be offered. The duke, it should be premised, is uncle to alessandra, and father of castiglione her betrothed.
Duke	why do you laugh?
Castiglione	ındeed.
I hardly know myself. Stay! Was it not
On yesterday we were speaking of the earl?
Of the earl politian? Yes! İt was yesterday.
Alessandra, you and ı, you must remember!
We were walking in the garden.
Duke	perfectly.
I do remember it-what of it-what then?
Castiglione	o nothing-nothing at all.
Duke	nothing at all!
It is most singular that you should laugh
At nothing at all!
Castiglione	most singular-singular!
Duke	look yon, castiglione, be so kind
As tell me, sir, at once what 'tis you mean.
What are you talking of?
Castiglione	was it not so?
We differed in opinion touching him.
Duke	him!-whom?
Castiglione	why, sir, the earl politian.
Duke	the earl of leicester! Yes!-is it he you mean?
We differed, indeed. If ı now recollect
The words you used were that the earl you knew
Was neither learned nor mirthful.
Castiglione	ha! Ha!-now did ı?
Duke	that did you, sir, and well ı knew at the time
You were wrong, it being not the character
Of the earl-whom all the world allows to be
A most hilarious man. Be not, my son,
Too positive again.
Castiglione	'tis singular!
Most singular! I could not think it possible
So little time could so much alter one!
To say the truth about an hour ago,
As ı was walking with the count san ozzo,
All arm in arm, we met this very man
The earl-he, with his friend baldazzar,
Having just arrived in rome. Ha! Ha! He is altered!
Such an account he gave me of his journey!
'Twould have made you die with laughter-such tales he told
Of his caprices and his merry freaks
Along the road-such oddity-such humor-
Such wit-such whim-such flashes of wild merriment
Set off too in such full relief by the grave
Demeanor of his friend-who, to speak the truth
Was gravity itself-
Duke	did ı not tell you?
Castiglione	you did-and yet 'tis strange! But true, as strange,
How much ı was mistaken! I always thought
The earl a gloomy man.
Duke	so, so, you see!
Be not too positive. Whom have we here?
It cannot be the earl?
Castiglione	the earl! Oh no!
Tis not the earl-but yet it is-and leaning
Upon his friend baldazzar. Ah! Welcome, sir!
[enter politian and baldazzar.]
My lord, a second welcome let me give you
To rome-his grace the duke of broglio.
Father! This is the earl politian, earl
Of leicester in great britain.
[politian bows haughtily.]
That, his friend
Baldazzar, duke of surrey. The earl has letters,
So please you, for your grace.
Duke	ha! Ha! Most welcome
To rome and to our palace, earl politian!
And you, most noble duke! I am glad to see you!
I knew your father well, my lord politian.
Castiglione! Call your cousin hither,
And let me make the noble earl acquainted
With your betrothed. You come, sir, at a time
Most seasonable. The wedding-
Politian	touching those letters, sir,
Your son made mention of-your son, is he not?-
Touching those letters, sir, ı wot not of them.
If such there be, my friend baldazzar here-
Baldazzar! Ah!-my friend baldazzar here
Will hand them to your grace. I would retire.
Duke	retire!-so soon?
Castiglione	what ho! Benito! Rupert!
His lordship's chambers-show his lordship to them!
His lordship is unwell.
[enter benito]
Benito	this way, my lord!
[exit, followed by politian.]
Duke	retire! Unwell!
Baldazzar	so please you, sir. I fear me
'Tis as you say-his lordship is unwell.
The damp air of the evening-the fatigue
Of a long journey-the-indeed ı had better
Follow his lordship. He must be unwell.
I will return anon.
Duke	return anon!
Now this is very strange! Castiglione!
This way, my son, ı wish to speak with thee.
You surely were mistaken in what you said
Of the earl, mirthful, indeed!-which of us said
Springs from the gems of circassy-
O! Nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill-
Or (music of the passion-hearted)
Joy's voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell,
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell-
O! Nothing of the dross of ours-
Yet all the beauty-all the flowers
That list our love, and deck our bowers-
Adorn yon world afar, afar-
The wandering star.

'Twas a sweet time for nesace-for there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
Near four bright suns-a temporary rest-
An oasis in desert of the blest.
Away away-'mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul-
The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
Can struggle to its destin'd eminence-
To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
And late to ours, the favour'd one of god-
But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,
She throws aside the sceptre-leaves the helm,
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely earth,
Whence sprang the "ıdea of beauty" into birth,
(falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,
Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,
It lit on hills achaian, and there dwelt),
She look'd into ınfinity-and knelt.
Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled-
Fit emblems of the model of her world-
Seen but in beauty-not impeding sight-
Of other beauty glittering thro' the light-
A wreath that twined each starry form around,
And all the opal'd air in color bound.

All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head
On the fair capo deucato, and sprang
So eagerly around about to hang
Upon the flying footsteps of-deep pride-
Of her who lov'd a mortal-and so died.
The sephalica, budding with young bees,
Uprear'd its purple stem around her knees:
And gemmy flower, of trebizond misnam'd-
Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd
All other loveliness: its honied dew
(the fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from heaven,
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
In trebizond-and on a sunny flower
So like its own above that, to this hour,
It still remaineth, torturing the bee
With madness, and unwonted reverie:
In heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
Disconsolate linger-grief that hangs her head,
Repenting follies that full long have fled,
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
Like guilty beauty, chasten'd, and more fair:
Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
And clytia pondering between many a sun,
While pettish tears adown her petals run:
And that aspiring flower that sprang on earth-
And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Its way to heaven, from garden of a king:
And valisnerian lotus thither flown
From struggling with the waters of the rhone:
And thy most lovely purple perfume, zante!
Isola d'oro!-fior di levante!
And the nelumbo bud that floats for ever
With ındian cupid down the holy river-
Fair flowers, and fairy! To whose care is given
To bear the goddess' song, in odors, up to heaven:

"spirit! That dwellest where,
In the deep sky,
The terrible and fair,
In beauty vie!
Beyond the line of blue-
The boundary of the star
Which turneth at the view
Of thy barrier and thy bar-
Of the barrier overgone
By the comets who were cast
From their pride, and from their throne
To be drudges till the last-
To be carriers of fire
(the red fire of their heart)
With speed that may not tire
And with pain that shall not part-
Who livest-that we know-
In eternity-we feel-
But the shadow of whose brow
What spirit shall reveal?
Tho' the beings whom thy nesace,
Thy messenger hath known
Have dream'd for thy ınfinity
A model of their own-
Thy will is done, o god!
The star hath ridden high
Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
Beneath thy burning eye;
And here, in thought, to thee-
In thought that can alone
Ascend thy empire and so be
A partner of thy throne-
By winged fantasy,
My embassy is given,
Till secrecy shall knowledge be
In the environs of heaven.

She ceas'd-and buried then her burning cheek
Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek
A shelter from the fervor of his eye;
For the stars trembled at the deity.
She stirr'd not-breath'd not-for a voice was there
How solemnly pervading the calm air!
A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name "the music of the sphere."
Ours is a world of words: quiet we call
"silence"-which is the merest word of all.

All nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from the visionary wings-
But ah! Not so when, thus, in realms on high
The eternal voice of god is passing by,
And the red winds are withering in the sky!
"what tho' in worlds which sightless cycles run,
Link'd to a little system, and one sun-
Where all my love is folly, and the crowd
Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath
(ah! Will they cross me in my angrier path?)
What tho' in worlds which own a single sun
The sands of time grow dimmer as they run,
Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
To bear my secrets thro' the upper heaven.
Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
With all thy train, athwart the moony sky-
Apart-like fire-flies in sicilian night,
And wing to other worlds another light!
Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
To the proud orbs that twinkle-and so be
To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban
Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!"

Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
The single-mooned eve!-on earth we plight
Our faith to one love-and one moon adore-
The birth-place of young beauty had no more.
As sprang that yellow star from downy hours,
Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
And bent o'er sheeny mountain and dim plain
Her way-but left not yet her therasaean reign.
Iı	high on a mountain of enamell'd head-
Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
With many a mutter'd "hope to be forgiven"
What time the moon is quadrated in heaven-
Of rosy head, that towering far away
Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
Of sunken suns at eve-at noon of night,
While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light-
Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,
Flashing from parian marble that twin smile
Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution, while they die-
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
A dome, by linked light from heaven let down,
Sat gently on these columns as a crown-
A window of one circular diamond, there,
Look'd out above into the purple air
And rays from god shot down that meteor chain
And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,
Save when, between th' empyrean and that ring,
Some eager spirit flapp'd his dusky wing.
But on the pillars seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world: that grayish green
That nature loves the best for beauty's grave
Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave-
And every sculptured cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peered out,
Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche-
Achaian statues in a world so rich?
Friezes from tadmor and persepolis-
From balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
Of beautiful gomorrah! Oh, the wave
Is now upon thee-but too late to save!
Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
Witness the murmur of the gray twilight
That stole upon the ear, in eyraco,
Of many a wild star-gazer long ago-
That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud-
Is not its form-its voice-most palpable and loud?
But what is this?-it cometh-and it brings
A music with it-'tis the rush of wings-
A pause-and then a sweeping, falling strain,
And nesace is in her halls again.
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
The zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
Within the centre of that hall to breathe
She paus'd and panted, zanthe! All beneath,
The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there!

Young flowers were whispering in melody
To happy flowers that night-and tree to tree;
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-light dell;
Yet silence came upon material things-
Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings-
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

"neath blue-bell or streamer-
Or tufted wild spray
That keeps, from the dreamer,
The moonbeam away-
Bright beings! That ponder,
With half-closing eyes,
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies,
Till they glance thro' the shade, and
Come down to your brow
Like-eyes of the maiden
Who calls on you now-
Arise! From your dreaming
In violet bowers,
To duty beseeming
These star-litten hours-
And shake from your tresses
Encumber'd with dew

The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too-
(o! How, without you, love!
Could angels be blest?)
Those kisses of true love
That lull'd ye to rest!
Up! Shake from your wing
Each hindering thing:
The dew of the night-
It would weigh down your flight;
And true love caresses-
O! Leave them apart!
They are light on the tresses,
But lead on the heart.

Ligeia! Ligeia!
My beautiful one!
Whose harshest idea
Will to melody run,
O! İs it thy will
On the breezes to toss?
Or, capriciously still,
Like the lone albatross,
Incumbent on night
(as she on the air)
To keep watch with delight
On the harmony there?

Ligeia! Wherever
Thy image may be,
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee.
Thou hast bound many eyes
In a dreamy sleep-
But the strains still arise
Which thy vigilance keep-

The sound of the rain
Which leaps down to the flower,
And dances again
In the rhythm of the shower-
The murmur that springs
From the growing of grass
Are the music of things-
But are modell'd, alas!
Away, then, my dearest,
O! Hie thee away
To springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moon-ray-
To lone lake that smiles,
In its dream of deep rest,
At the many star-isles
That enjewel its breast-
Where wild flowers, creeping,
Have mingled their shade,
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid-
Some have left the cool glade, and
Have slept with the bee-
Arouse them, my maiden,
On moorland and lea-

Go! Breathe on their slumber,
All softly in ear,
The musical number
They slumber'd to hear-
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon,
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test,
The rhythmical number
Which lull'd him to rest?"

Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
A thousand seraphs burst th' empyrean thro',
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight-
Seraphs in all but "knowledge," the keen light
That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds afar,
O death! From eye of god upon that star;
Sweet was that error-sweeter still that death-
Sweet was that error-ev'n with us the breath
Of science dims the mirror of our joy-
To them 'twere the simoom, and would destroy-
For what (to them) availeth it to know
That truth is falsehood-or that bliss is woe?
Sweet was their death-with them to die was rife
With the last ecstasy of satiate life-
Beyond that death no immortality-
But sleep that pondereth and is not "to be"-
And there-oh! May my weary spirit dwell-
Apart from heaven's eternity-and yet how far from hell!

What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
But two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts
To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover-
O! Where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
Was love, the blind, near sober duty known?
Unguided love hath fallen-'mid "tears of perfect moan."

He was a goodly spirit-he who fell:
A wanderer by mossy-mantled well-
A gazer on the lights that shine above-
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
What wonder? For each star is eye-like there,
And looks so sweetly down on beauty's hair-
And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
The night had found (to him a night of wo)
Upon a mountain crag, young angelo-
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
Here sate he with his love-his dark eye bent
With eagle gaze along the firmament:
Now turn'd it upon her-but ever then
It trembled to the orb of earth again.

"ıanthe, dearest, see! How dim that ray!
How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
She seemed not thus upon that autumn eve
I left her gorgeous halls-nor mourned to leave,
That eve-that eve-ı should remember well-
The sun-ray dropped, in lemnos with a spell
On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Wherein ı sate, and on the draperied wall-
And on my eyelids-o, the heavy light!
How drowsily it weighed them into night!
On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
With persian saadi in his gulistan:
But o, that light!-ı slumbered-death, the while,
Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
So softly that no single silken hair
Awoke that slept-or knew that he was there.

"the last spot of earth's orb ı trod upon
Was a proud temple called the parthenon;
More beauty clung around her columned wall
Then even thy glowing bosom beats withal,
And when old time my wing did disenthral
Thence sprang ı-as the eagle from his tower,
And years ı left behind me in an hour.
What time upon her airy bounds ı hung,
One half the garden of her globe was flung
Unrolling as a chart unto my view-
Tenantless cities of the desert too!
Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
And half ı wished to be again of men."

"my angelo! And why of them to be?
A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee-
And greener fields than in yon world above,
And woman's loveliness-and passionate love."
"but list, ıanthe! When the air so soft

Tamerlane
Kind solace in a dying hour!
Such, father, is not (now) my theme-
I will not madly deem that power
Of earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revelled in-
I have no time to dote or dream:
You call it hope-that fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire:
If ı can hope-o god! I can-
Its fount is holier-more divine-
I would not call thee fool, old man,
But such is not a gift of thine.

Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bowed from its wild pride into shame
O yearning heart! I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame,
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the jewels of my throne,
Halo of hell! And with a pain
Not hell shall make me fear again-
O craving heart, for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours!
The undying voice of that dead time,
With its interminable chime,
Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
Upon thy emptiness-a knell.

I have not always been as now:
The fevered diadem on my brow
I claimed and won usurpingly-
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the caesar-this to me?
The heritage of a kingly mind,
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind.
On mountain soil ı first drew life:
The mists of the taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head,
And, ı believe, the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair.

So late from heaven-that dew-it fell
('mid dreams of an unholy night)
Upon me with the touch of hell,
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,
Appeared to my half-closing eye
The pageantry of monarchy;
And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
Came hurriedly upon me, telling
Of human battle, where my voice,
My own voice, silly child!-was swelling
(o! How my spirit would rejoice,
And leap within me at the cry)
The battle-cry of victory!

The rain came down upon my head
Unsheltered-and the heavy wind
Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
It was but man, ı thought, who shed
Laurels upon me: and the rush-
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires-with the captive's prayer-
The hum of suitors-and the tone
Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.

My passions, from that hapless hour,
Usurped a tyranny which men
Have deemed since ı have reached to power,
My innate nature-be it so:
But, father, there lived one who, then,
Then-in my boyhood-when their fire
Burned with a still intenser glow
(for passion must, with youth, expire)
E'en then who knew this iron heart
In woman's weakness had a part.

I have no words-alas!-to tell
The loveliness of loving well!
Nor would ı now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
Are-shadows on th' unstable wind:
Thus ı remember having dwelt
Some page of early lore upon,
With loitering eye, till ı have felt
The letters-with their meaning-melt
To fantasies-with none.

O, she was worthy of all love!
Love as in infancy was mine-
'Twas such as angel minds above
Might envy; her young heart the shrine
On which my every hope and thought
Were incense-then a goodly gift,
For they were childish and upright-
Pure-as her young example taught:
Why did ı leave it, and, adrift,
Trust to the fire within, for light?

We grew in age-and love-together-
Roaming the forest, and the wild;
My breast her shield in wintry weather-
And, when the friendly sunshine smiled.
And she would mark the opening skies,
I saw no heaven-but in her eyes.
Young love's first lesson is--the heart:
For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
When, from our little cares apart,
And laughing at her girlish wiles,
I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
And pour my spirit out in tears-
There was no need to speak the rest-
No need to quiet any fears
Of her-who asked no reason why,
But turned on me her quiet eye!

Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with, and strove
When, on the mountain peak, alone,
Ambition lent it a new tone-
I had no being-but in thee:
The world, and all it did contain
In the earth-the air-the sea-
Its joy-its little lot of pain
That was new pleasure-the ideal,
Dim, vanities of dreams by night-
And dimmer nothings which were real-
(shadows-and a more shadowy light!)
Parted upon their misty wings,
And, so, confusedly, became
Thine image and-a name-a name!
Two separate-yet most intimate things.

I was ambitious-have you known
The passion, father? You have not:
A cottager, ı marked a throne
Of half the world as all my own,
And murmured at such lowly lot-
But, just like any other dream,
Upon the vapor of the dew
My own had past, did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro'
The minute-the hour-the day-oppress
My mind with double loveliness.

We walked together on the crown
Of a high mountain which looked down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest, on the hills-
The dwindled hills! Begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills.

I spoke to her of power and pride,
But mystically-in such guise
That she might deem it nought beside
The moment's converse; in her eyes
I read, perhaps too carelessly-
A mingled feeling with my own-
The flush on her bright cheek, to me
Seemed to become a queenly throne
Too well that ı should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone.

I wrapped myself in grandeur then,
And donned a visionary crown-
Yet it was not that fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me-
But that, among the rabble-men,
Lion ambition is chained down-
And crouches to a keeper's hand-
Not so in deserts where the grand-
The wild-the terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire.

Look 'round thee now on samarcand!-
Is she not queen of earth? Her pride
Above all cities? İn her hand
Their destinies? İn all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone?
Falling-her veriest stepping-stone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne-
And who her sovereign? Timour-he
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding o'er empires haughtily
A diademed outlaw!

O, human love! Thou spirit given,
On earth, of all we hope in heaven!
Which fall'st into the soul like rain
Upon the siroc-withered plain,
And, failing in thy power to bless,
But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
Idea! Which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth-
Farewell! For ı have won the earth.

When hope, the eagle that towered, could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky,
His pinions were bent droopingly-
And homeward turned his softened eye.
'Twas sunset: when the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun.
That soul will hate the ev'ning mist
So often lovely, and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness (known
To those whose spirits hearken) as one
Who, in a dream of night, would fly,
But cannot, from a danger nigh.

What tho' the moon-tho' the white moon
Shed all the splendor of her noon,
Her smile is chilly-and her beam,
In that time of dreariness, will seem
(so like you gather in your breath)
A portrait taken after death.
And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one-
For all we live to know is known,
And all we seek to keep hath flown-
Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
With the noon-day beauty-which is all.
I reached my home-my home no more-
For all had flown who made it so.
I passed from out its mossy door,
And, tho' my tread was soft and low,
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom ı had earlier known-
O, ı defy thee, hell, to show
On beds of fire that burn below,
An humbler heart-a deeper woe.

Father, ı firmly do believe-
I know-for death who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar,
Where there is nothing to deceive,
Hath left his iron gate ajar.
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro' eternity--
I do believe that eblis hath
A snare in every human path-
Else how, when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol, love,-
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt-offerings
From the most unpolluted things,
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trellised rays from heaven
No mote may shun-no tiniest fly-
The light'ning of his eagle eye-
How was it that ambition crept,
Unseen, amid the revels there,
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of love's very hair!
.

To helen
Helen, thy beauty is to me
Like those nicean barks of yore,
That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
To his own native shore.

On desperate seas long wont to roam,
Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
Thy naiad airs have brought me home
To the glory that was greece,
To the grandeur that was rome.

Lo! İn yon brilliant window niche,
How statue-like ı see thee stand,
The agate lamp within thy hand!
Ah, psyche, from the regions which
Are holy land!

The valley of unrest
Once it smiled a silent dell
Where the people did not dwell;
They had gone unto the wars,
Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
Nightly, from their azure towers,
To keep watch above the flowers,
In the midst of which all day
The red sun-light lazily lay,
Now each visitor shall confess
The sad valley's restlessness.
Nothing there is motionless-
Nothing save the airs that brood
Over the magic solitude.
Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
That palpitate like the chill seas
Around the misty hebrides!
Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
That rustle through the unquiet heaven
Unceasingly, from morn till even,
Over the violets there that lie
In myriad types of the human eye-
Over the lilies that wave
And weep above a nameless grave!
They wave:-from out their fragrant tops
Eternal dews come down in drops.
They weep:-from off their delicate stems
Perennial tears descend in gems.

Israfel
In heaven a spirit doth dwell
"whose heart-strings are a lute;"
None sing so wildly well
As the angel ısrafel,
And the giddy stars (so legends tell),
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
Of his voice, all mute.

Tottering above
In her highest noon,
The enamoured moon
Blushes with love,
While, to listen, the red levin
(with the rapid pleiads, even,
Which were seven),
Pauses in heaven.

And they say (the starry choir
And the other listening things)
That ısrafeli's fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings-
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.

But the skies that angel trod,
Where deep thoughts are a duty-
Where love's a grow-up god-
Where the houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star.

Therefore, thou art not wrong,
Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassioned song;
To thee the laurels belong,
Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live and long!

The ecstasies above
With thy burning measures suit-
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
With the fervor of thy lute-
Well may the stars be mute!

Yes, heaven is thine; but this
Is a world of sweets and sours;
Our flowers are merely-flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours.

If ı could dwell
Where ısrafel
Hath dwelt, and he where ı,
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky.

To --
I heed not that my earthly lot
Hath-little of earth in it-
That years of love have been forgot
In the hatred of a minute:-
I mourn not that the desolate
Are happier, sweet, than ı,
But that you sorrow for my fate
Who am a passer-by.


To --
The bowers whereat, in dreams, ı see
The wantonest singing birds,

Are lips-and all thy melody
Of lip-begotten words-

Thine eyes, in heaven of heart enshrined
Then desolately fall,
O god! On my funereal mind
Like starlight on a pall-

Thy heart-thy heart!-ı wake and sigh,
And sleep to dream till day

Of the truth that gold can never buy-
Of the baubles that it may.


To the river
Fair river! İn thy bright, clear flow
Of crystal, wandering water,
Thou art an emblem of the glow
Of beauty-the unhidden heart-
The playful maziness of art
In old alberto's daughter;

But when within thy wave she looks-
Which glistens then, and trembles-
Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
Her worshipper resembles;
For in his heart, as in thy stream,
Her image deeply lies-
His heart which trembles at the beam
Of her soul-searching eyes.


Song
I saw thee on thy bridal day-
When a burning blush came o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee:

And in thine eye a kindling light
(whatever it might be)
Was all on earth my aching sight
Of loveliness could see.

That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-
As such it well may pass-
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him, alas!

Who saw thee on that bridal day,
When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee.


Spirits of the dead
Thy soul shall find itself alone
'Mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone
Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
Into thine hour of secrecy.
Be silent in that solitude
Which is not loneliness-for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
In life before thee are again
In death around thee-and their will
Shall overshadow thee: be still.
The night-tho' clear-shall frown-
And the stars shall not look down
From their high thrones in the heaven,
With light like hope to mortals given-
But their red orbs, without beam,
To thy weariness shall seem
As a burning and a fever
Which would cling to thee forever.
Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish-
Now are visions ne'er to vanish-
From thy spirit shall they pass
No more-like dew-drops from the grass.
The breeze-the breath of god-is still-
And the mist upon the hill
Shadowy-shadowy-yet unbroken,
Is a symbol and a token-
How it hangs upon the trees,
A mystery of mysteries!


A dream
In visions of the dark night
I have dreamed of joy departed-
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken-hearted.
Ah! What is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turned back upon the past?
That holy dream-that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheered me as a lovely beam,
A lonely spirit guiding.
What though that light, thro' storm and night,
So trembled from afar-
What could there be more purely bright
In truth's day star?


Romance
Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
With drowsy head and folded wing,
Among the green leaves as they shake
Far down within some shadowy lake,
To me a painted paroquet
Hath been-a most familiar bird-
Taught me my alphabet to say-
To lisp my very earliest word
While in the wild wood ı did lie,
A child-with a most knowing eye.

Of late, eternal condor years
So shake the very heaven on high
With tumult as they thunder by,
I have no time for idle cares
Though gazing on the unquiet sky.
And when an hour with calmer wings
Its down upon my spirit flings-
That little time with lyre and rhyme
To while away-forbidden things!
My heart would feel to be a crime
Unless it trembled with the strings.

Note

Fairyland
Dim vales-and shadowy floods-
And cloudy-looking woods,
Whose forms we can't discover
For the tears that drip all over
Huge moons there wax and wane-
Again-again-again-
Every moment of the night-
Forever changing places-
And they put out the star-light
With the breath from their pale faces.
About twelve by the moon-dial
One more filmy than the rest
(a kind which, upon trial,
They have found to be the best)
Comes down-still down-and down
With its centre on the crown
Of a mountain's eminence,
While its wide circumference
In easy drapery falls
Over hamlets, over halls,
Wherever they may be-
O'er the strange woods-o'er the sea-
Over spirits on the wing-
Over every drowsy thing-
And buries them up quite
In a labyrinth of light-
And then, how deep!-o, deep!
Is the passion of their sleep.
In the morning they arise,
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies,
With the tempests as they toss,
Like-almost any thing-
Or a yellow albatross.
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before-
Videlicet a tent-
Which ı think extravagant:
Its atomies, however,
Into a shower dissever,
Of which those butterflies,
Of earth, who seek the skies,
And so come down again
(never-contented thing!)
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings.


The lake
In spring of youth it was my lot
To haunt of the wide world a spot
The which ı could not love the less-
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
And the tall pines that towered around.

But when the night had thrown her pall
Upon the spot, as upon all,
And the mystic wind went by
Murmuring in melody-
Then-ah, then, ı would awake
To the terror of the lone lake.

Yet that terror was not fright,
But a tremulous delight-
A feeling not the jewelled mine
Could teach or bribe me to define-
Nor love-although the love were thine.

Death was in that poisonous wave,
And in its gulf a fitting grave
For him who thence could solace bring
To his lone imagining-
Whose solitary soul could make
An eden of that dim lake.


Evening star
'Twas noontide of summer,
And midtime of night,
And stars, in their orbits,
Shone pale, through the light
Of the brighter, cold moon.
'Mid planets her slaves,
Herself in the heavens,
Her beam on the waves.

I gazed awhile
On her cold smile;
Too cold-too cold for me-
There passed, as a shroud,
A fleecy cloud,
And ı turned away to thee,
Proud evening star,
In thy glory afar
And dearer thy beam shall be;
For joy to my heart
Is the proud part
Thou bearest in heaven at night,
And more ı admire
Thy distant fire,
Than that colder, lowly light.


Imitation
A dark unfathomed tide
Of interminable pride-
A mystery, and a dream,
Should my early life seem;
I say that dream was fraught
With a wild and waking thought
Of beings that have been,
Which my spirit hath not seen,
Had ı let them pass me by,
With a dreaming eye!
Let none of earth inherit
That vision on my spirit;
Those thoughts ı would control,
As a spell upon his soul:
For that bright hope at last
And that light time have past,
And my wordly rest hath gone
With a sigh as it passed on:
I care not though it perish
With a thought ı then did cherish.


"the happiest day"

My seared and blighted heart hath known,
The highest hope of pride and power,
I feel hath flown.

But they have vanished long, alas!

Now offered with the pain

I would not live again:
Vı	for on its wing was dark alloy
And as it fluttered-fell
An essence-powerful to destroy
A soul that knew it well.


Hymn (translation from the greek
Hymn to aristogeiton and harmodius
I	wreathed in myrtle, my sword ı'll conceal,
Like those champions devoted and brave,
When they plunged in the tyrant their steel,
And to athens deliverance gave.
Iı	beloved heroes! Your deathless souls roam
In the joy breathing isles of the blest;
Where the mighty of old have their home-
Where achilles and diomed rest.

A libation of tyranny's blood.

Endless ages shall cherish your fame,
Embalmed in their echoing songs!


Dreams
Oh! That my young life were a lasting dream!
My spirit not awakening, till the beam
Of an eternity should bring the morrow.
Yes! Though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
'Twere better than the cold reality
Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
But should it be-that dream eternally
Continuing-as dreams have been to me
In my young boyhood-should it thus be given,
'Twere folly still to hope for higher heaven.
For ı have revelled when the sun was bright
I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
And loveliness,-have left my very heart
Inclines of my imaginary apart
From mine own home, with beings that have been
Of mine own thought-what more could ı have seen?
'Twas once-and only once-and the wild hour
From my remembrance shall not pass-some power
Or spell had bound me-'twas the chilly wind
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
Its image on my spirit-or the moon
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly-or the stars-howe'er it was
That dream was that that night-wind-let it pass.
I have been happy, though in a dream.
I have been happy-and ı love the theme:
Dreams! İn their vivid coloring of life
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
Of semblance with reality which brings
To the delirious eye, more lovely things
Of paradise and love-and all my own!-
Than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known.

Admiring nature's universal throne;
Her woods-her wilds-her mountains-the intense
Reply of hers to our intelligence!
I	ın youth ı have known one with whom the earth
In secret communing held-as he with it,
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
A passionate light such for his spirit was fit-
And yet that spirit knew-not in the hour
Of its own fervor-what had o'er it power.
Iı	perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
To a ferver by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
But ı will half believe that wild light fraught
With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told-or is it of a thought
The unembodied essence, and no more
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
As dew of the night-time, o'er the summer grass?
Iıı	doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye
To the loved object-so the tear to the lid
Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
And yet it need not be-(that object) hid
From us in life-but common-which doth lie
Each hour before us-but then only bid
With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken
T' awake us-'tis a symbol and a token-
Iv	of what in other worlds shall be-and given
In beauty by our god, to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and heaven
Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
Though not with faith-with godliness-whose throne
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown.

Vıı	of the dead-dead who lies
All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes.
And the life upon her hair.
Vııı	thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike-the murmur sent
Through the gray chambers to my song,
Shall be the accompaniment.
Ix	thou diedst in thy life's june-
But thou didst not die too fair:
Thou didst not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.
X	from more than friends on earth,
Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven.-
Xı	therefore, to thee this night
I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
With a paean of old days.
Notes
On the "poems written in youth" little comment is needed. This section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of (which was subsequently suppressed), such poems from the first and second published volumes of and as have not already been given in their revised versions, and a few others collected from various sources.

Note on al aaraaf
"al aaraaf" first appeared, with the sonnet "to silence" prefixed to it, in , and is, substantially, as originally issued. In the edition for , however, this poem, its author's longest, was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines, which have been omitted in all subsequent collections: mysterious star!
Thou wert my dream
All a long summer night-
Be now my theme!
By this clear stream,
Of thee will ı write;
Meantime from afar
Bathe me in light!

Thy world has not the dross of ours,
Yet all the beauty-all the flowers
That list our love or deck our bowers
In dreamy gardens, where do lie
Dreamy maidens all the day;
While the silver winds of circassy
On violet couches faint away.
Little-oh! Little dwells in thee
Like unto what on earth we see:
Beauty's eye is here the bluest
In the falsest and untruest-
On the sweetest air doth float
The most sad and solemn note-
If with thee be broken hearts,
Joy so peacefully departs,
That its echo still doth dwell,
Like the murmur in the shell.
Thou! Thy truest type of grief
Is the gently falling leaf-
Thou! Thy framing is so holy
Sorrow is not melancholy.

Note on tamerlane
The earliest version of "tamerlane" was included in the suppressed volume of , but differs very considerably from the poem as now published. The present draft, besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original, is more carefully punctuated, and, the lines being indented, presents a more pleasing appearance, to the eye at least.

Note on to helen, the valley of unrest, ısrafel etc.
"to helen" first appeared in the volume, as did also "the valley of unrest" (as "the valley nis"), "ısrafel," and one or two others of the youthful pieces.

Note on romance
The poem styled "romance" constituted the preface of the volume, but with the addition of the following lines: succeeding years, too wild for song,
Then rolled like tropic storms along,
Where, though the garish lights that fly
Dying along the troubled sky,
Lay bare, through vistas thunder-riven,
The blackness of the general heaven,
That very blackness yet doth fling
Light on the lightning's silver wing.

For being an idle boy lang syne,
Who read anacreon and drank wine,
I early found anacreon rhymes
Were almost passionate sometimes-
And by strange alchemy of brain
His pleasures always turned to pain-
His naivete to wild desire-
His wit to love-his wine to fire-
And so, being young and dipt in folly,
I fell in love with melancholy.

And used to throw my earthly rest
And quiet all away in jest-
I could not love except where death
Was mingling his with beauty's breath-
Or hymen, time, and destiny,
Were stalking between her and me.

...

But now my soul hath too much room-
Gone are the glory and the gloom-
The black hath mellow'd into gray,
And all the fires are fading away.

My draught of passion hath been deep-
I revell'd, and ı now would sleep-
And after drunkenness of soul
Succeeds the glories of the bowl-
An idle longing night and day
To dream my very life away.

But dreams-of those who dream as ı,
Aspiringly, are damned, and die:
Yet should ı swear ı mean alone,
By notes so very shrilly blown,
To break upon time's monotone,
While yet my vapid joy and grief
Are tintless of the yellow leaf-
Why not an imp the greybeard hath,
Will shake his shadow in my path-
And e'en the greybeard will o'erlook
Connivingly my dreaming-book.

Doubtful poems
Alone
From childhood's hour ı have not been
As others were-ı have not seen
As others saw-ı could not bring
My passions from a common spring-
From the same source ı have not taken
My sorrow-ı could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone-
And all ı loved-ı loved alone-
Thou-in my childhood-in the dawn
Of a most stormy life-was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still-
From the torrent, or the fountain-
From the red cliff of the mountain-
From the sun that round me roll'd
In its autumn tint of gold-
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by-
From the thunder and the storm-
And the cloud that took the form
(when the rest of heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view.

To ısadore
I	beneath the vine-clad eaves,
Whose shadows fall before
Thy lowly cottage door-
Under the lilac's tremulous leaves-
Within thy snowy clasped hand
The purple flowers it bore.
Last eve in dreams, ı saw thee stand,
Like queenly nymph from fairy-land-
Enchantress of the flowery wand,
Most beauteous ısadore!
Iı	and when ı bade the dream
Upon thy spirit flee,
Thy violet eyes to me
Upturned, did overflowing seem
With the deep, untold delight
Of love's serenity;
Thy classic brow, like lilies white
And pale as the ımperial night
Upon her throne, with stars bedight,
Enthralled my soul to thee!
Iıı	ah! Ever ı behold
Thy dreamy, passionate eyes,
Blue as the languid skies
Hung with the sunset's fringe of gold;
Now strangely clear thine image grows,
And olden memories
Are startled from their long repose
Like shadows on the silent snows
When suddenly the night-wind blows
Where quiet moonlight lies.
Iv	like music heard in dreams,
Like strains of harps unknown,
Of birds for ever flown,-
Audible as the voice of streams
That murmur in some leafy dell,
I hear thy gentlest tone,
And silence cometh with her spell
Like that which on my tongue doth dwell,
When tremulous in dreams ı tell
My love to thee alone!
V	ın every valley heard,
Floating from tree to tree,
Less beautiful to me,
The music of the radiant bird,
Than artless accents such as thine
Whose echoes never flee!
Ah! How for thy sweet voice ı pine:-
For uttered in thy tones benign
(enchantress!) This rude name of mine
Doth seem a melody!
Note

The village street
In these rapid, restless shadows,
Once ı walked at eventide,
When a gentle, silent maiden,
Walked in beauty at my side.
She alone there walked beside me
All in beauty, like a bride.

Pallidly the moon was shining
On the dewy meadows nigh;
On the silvery, silent rivers,
On the mountains far and high,-
On the ocean's star-lit waters,
Where the winds a-weary die.

Slowly, silently we wandered
From the open cottage door,
Underneath the elm's long branches
To the pavement bending o'er;
Underneath the mossy willow
And the dying sycamore.

With the myriad stars in beauty
All bedight, the heavens were seen,
Radiant hopes were bright around me,
Like the light of stars serene;
Like the mellow midnight splendor
Of the night's irradiate queen.

Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
Like the distant murmured music
Of unquiet, lovely seas;
While the winds were hushed in slumber
In the fragrant flowers and trees.

Wondrous and unwonted beauty
Still adorning all did seem,
While ı told my love in fables
'Neath the willows by the stream;
Would the heart have kept unspoken
Love that was its rarest dream!

Instantly away we wandered
In the shadowy twilight tide,
She, the silent, scornful maiden,
Walking calmly at my side,
With a step serene and stately,
All in beauty, all in pride.

Vacantly ı walked beside her.
On the earth mine eyes were cast;
Swift and keen there came unto me
Bitter memories of the past-
On me, like the rain in autumn
On the dead leaves, cold and fast.

Underneath the elms we parted,
By the lowly cottage door;
One brief word alone was uttered-
Never on our lips before;
And away ı walked forlornly,
Broken-hearted evermore.

Slowly, silently ı loitered,
Homeward, in the night, alone;
Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
That my youth had never known;
Wild unrest, like that which cometh
When the night's first dream hath flown.

Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
Mad, discordant melodies,
And keen melodies like shadows
Haunt the moaning willow trees,
And the sycamores with laughter
Mock me in the nightly breeze.

Sad and pale the autumn moonlight
Through the sighing foliage streams;
And each morning, midnight shadow,
Shadow of my sorrow seems;
Strive, o heart, forget thine idol!
And, o soul, forget thy dreams! Note

The forest reverie
'Tis said that when
The hands of men
Tamed this primeval wood,
And hoary trees with groans of wo,
Like warriors by an unknown foe,
Were in their strength subdued,
The virgin earth
Gave instant birth
To springs that ne'er did flow-
That in the sun
Did rivulets run,
And all around rare flowers did blow-
The wild rose pale
Perfumed the gale,
And the queenly lily adown the dale
(whom the sun and the dew
And the winds did woo),
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.

So when in tears
The love of years
Is wasted like the snow,
And the fine fibrils of its life
By the rude wrong of instant strife
Are broken at a blow-
Within the heart
Do springs upstart
Of which it doth now know,
And strange, sweet dreams,
Like silent streams
That from new fountains overflow,
With the earlier tide
Of rivers glide
Deep in the heart whose hope has died-
Quenching the fires its ashes hide,-
Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
Sweet flowers, ere long,-
The rare and radiant flowers of song! Note

Notes
Note on alone
Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of edgar poe, and not included among his known writings, the lines entitled "a
Alone walk'd she; but, viewlessly
Walk'd spirits at her side.

Peace charm'd the street beneath her feet,
And honor charm'd the air;
And all astir looked kind on her,
And called her good as fair-
For all god ever gave to her
She kept with chary care.

She kept with care her beauties rare
From lovers warm and true-
For heart was cold to all but gold,
And the rich came not to woo-
But honor'd well her charms to sell,
If priests the selling do.

Now walking there was one more fair-
A slight girl, lily-pale;
And she had unseen company
To make the spirit quail-
Twixt want and scorn she walk'd forlorn,
And nothing could avail.

No mercy now can clear her brow
From this world's peace to pray,
For as love's wild prayer dissolved in air,
Her woman's heart gave way!-
With truth, so taste informs us of the beautiful, while the moral sense is regardful of duty. Of this latter, while conscience teaches the obligation, and reason the expediency, taste contents herself with displaying the charms, waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her deformity, her disproportion, her animosity to the fitting, to the appropriate, to the harmonious, in a word, to beauty.

İn question is at least most readily attainable in the poem. It by no means follows, however, that the incitements of passion, or the precepts of duty, or even the lessons of truth, may not be introduced into a poem, and with advantage; for they may subserve incidentally, in various ways, the general purposes of the work: but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem.

I cannot better introduce the few poems which ı shall present for your consideration, than by the citation of the proem to longfellow's "waif": the day is done, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of night,
As a feather is wafted downward
From an eagle in his flight.

I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me,
That my soul cannot resist;

A feeling of sadness and longing,
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain.

Come, read to me some poem,
Some simple and heartfelt lay,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the grand old masters,
Not from the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridors of time.

For, like strains of martial music,
Their mighty thoughts suggest
Life's endless toil and endeavor;
And to-night ı long for rest.

Read from some humbler poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart,
As showers from the clouds of summer,
Or tears from the eyelids start;

Who through long days of labor,
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have power to quiet
The restless pulse of care,
And come like the benediction
That follows after prayer.

Then read from the treasured volume
Stupid; and has no more right to be considered "easy" or "natural" than a cockney exquisite, or than the sleeping beauty in the waxworks.

Among the minor poems of bryant, none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles "june." ı quote only a portion of it: there, through the long, long summer hours,
The golden light should lie,
And thick young herbs and groups of flowers
Stand in their beauty by.
The oriole should build and tell
His love-tale, close beside my cell;
The idle butterfly
Should rest him there, and there be heard
The housewife-bee and humming bird.

And what, if cheerful shouts at noon,
Come, from the village sent,
Or songs of maids, beneath the moon,
With fairy laughter blent?
And what if, in the evening light,
Betrothed lovers walk in sight
Of my low monument?
I would the lovely scene around
Might know no sadder sight nor sound.

I know, ı know ı should not see
The season's glorious show,
Nor would its brightness shine for me;
Nor its wild music flow;

But if, around my place of sleep,
The friends ı love should come to weep,
They might not haste to go.
Soft airs and song, and light and bloom,
Should keep them lingering by my tomb.

These to their soften'd hearts should bear
The thought of what has been,
And speak of one who cannot share
The gladness of the scene;
Whose part in all the pomp that fills
The circuit of the summer hills,
Is-that his grave is green;
And deeply would their hearts rejoice
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain. The taint of which ı speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as "the health" of edward coote pinkney: ı fill this cup to one made up
Of loveliness alone,
A woman, of her gentle sex
The seeming paragon;
To whom the better elements
And kindly stars have given
A form so fair, that like the air,
'Tis less of earth than heaven.

Her every tone is music's own,
Like those of morning birds,
And something more than melody
Dwells ever in her words;
The coinage of her heart are they,
And from her lips each flows
As one may see the burden'd bee
Forth issue from the rose.

Affections are as thoughts to her,
The measures of her hours;
Her feelings have the fragrancy,
The freshness of young flowers;
And lovely passions, changing oft,
So fill her, she appears
The image of themselves by turns,-
The idol of past years!

Of her bright face one glance will trace
A picture on the brain,
And of her voice in echoing hearts
A sound must long remain;
But memory, such as mine of her,
So very much endears,
When death is nigh my latest sigh
Will not be life's, but hers.

I fill'd this cup to one made up
Of loveliness alone,
A woman, of her gentle sex
The seeming paragon-
Her health! And would on earth there stood,
Some more of such a frame,
That life might be all poetry,
Though the herd have fled from thee, thy home is still here;
Here still is the smile, that no cloud can o'ercast,
And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last.

Oh! What was love made for, if 'tis not the same
Through joy and through torment, through glory and shame?
I know not, ı ask not, if guilt's in that heart,
I but know that ı love thee, whatever thou art.

Thou hast call'd me thy angel in moments of bliss,
And thy angel ı'll be,'mid the horrors of this,-
To dazzle when the sun is down
And rob the world of rest
She took our daylight with her,
The smiles that we love best,
With morning blushes on her cheek,
And pearls upon her breast.

O turn again, fair ınes,
Before the fall of night,
For fear the moon should shine alone,
And stars unrivall'd bright;
And blessed will the lover be
That walks beneath their light,
And breathes the love against thy cheek
I dare not even write!

Would ı had been, fair ınes,
That gallant cavalier,
Who rode so gaily by thy side,
And whisper'd thee so near!
Were there no bonny dames at home,
Or no true lovers here,
That he should cross the seas to win
The dearest of the dear?

I saw thee, lovely ınes,
Descend along the shore,
With bands of noble gentlemen,
And banners-waved before;
And gentle youth and maidens gay,
And snowy plumes they wore;
It would have been a beauteous dream,
If it had been no more!

Alas, alas, fair ınes,
She went away with song,
With music waiting on her steps,
And shoutings of the throng;
But some were sad and felt no mirth,
But only music's wrong,
In sounds that sang farewell, farewell,
To her you've loved so long.

Farewell, farewell, fair ınes,
That vessel never bore
So fair a lady on its deck,
Nor danced so light before,-
Alas for pleasure on the sea,
And sorrow on the shore!
The smile that blest one lover's heart
Weary of breath,
Rashly importunate
Gone to her death!

Take her up tenderly,
Lift her with care;-
Fashion'd so slenderly,
Young and so fair!

Look at her garments
Clinging like cerements;
Whilst the wave constantly
Drips from her clothing;
Take her up instantly,
Loving, not loathing.

Touch her not scornfully
Think of her mournfully,
Gently and humanly;
Not of the stains of her,
All that remains of her
Now is pure womanly.

Make no deep scrutiny
Into her mutiny
Rash and undutiful;
Past all dishonor,
Death has left on her
Only the beautiful.

Where the lamps quiver
So far in the river,
With many a light
From window and casement,
From garret to basement,
She stood, with amazement,
Houseless by night.

The bleak wind of march
Made her tremble and shiver;
But not the dark arch,
Or the black flowing river:
Mad from life's history,
Glad to death's mystery,
Swift to be hurl'd-
Anywhere, anywhere
Out of the world!

In she plunged boldly,
No matter how coldly
The rough river ran,-
Over the brink of it,
Picture it,-think of it,
Dissolute man!
Lave in it, drink of it
Then, if you can!

Still, for all slips of hers,
One of eve's family-
Wipe those poor lips of hers
Oozing so clammily,
Loop up her tresses
Escaped from the comb,
Her fair auburn tresses;
Whilst wonderment guesses
Where was her home?

Who was her father?
Who was her mother!
Had she a sister?
Had she a brother?
Or was there a dearer one
Still, and a nearer one
Yet, than all other?

Alas! For the rarity
Of christian charity
Under the sun!
Oh! İt was pitiful!
Near a whole city full,
Home she had none.

Sisterly, brotherly,
Fatherly, motherly,
Feelings had changed:
Love, by harsh evidence,
Thrown from its eminence;
Even god's providence
Seeming estranged.

Take her up tenderly;
Lift her with care;
Fashion'd so slenderly,
Young, and so fair!
Ere her limbs frigidly
Stiffen too rigidly,
Decently,-kindly,-
Smooth and compose them;
And her eyes, close them,
Staring so blindly!

Dreadfully staring
Through muddy impurity,
As when with the daring
Last look of despairing
Fixed on futurity.

Perishing gloomily,
Spurred by contumely,
Cold inhumanity,
Burning insanity,
Into her rest,-
Cross her hands humbly,
As if praying dumbly,
Over her breast!
Owning her weakness,
Her evil behavior,
And the star of my fate hath declined,
Thy soft heart refused to discover
The faults which so many could find;
Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,
It shrunk not to share it with me,
And the love which my spirit hath painted
It never hath found but in thee.

Then when nature around me is smiling,
The last smile which answers to mine,
I do not believe it beguiling,
Because it reminds me of thine;
And when winds are at war with the ocean,
As the breasts ı believed in with me,
If their billows excite an emotion,
It is that they bear me from thee.

Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,
And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
Though ı feel that my soul is delivered
To pain-it shall not be its slave.
There is many a pang to pursue me:
They may crush, but they shall not contemn-
They may torture, but shall not subdue me-
'Tis of thee that ı think-not of them.

Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
Though slandered, thou never couldst shake,-
Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
Though parted, it was not to fly,
Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,
Nor mute, that the world might belie.

Yet ı blame not the world, nor despise it,
Nor the war of the many with one-
If my soul was not fitted to prize it,
'Twas folly not sooner to shun:
And if dearly that error hath cost me,
And more than ı once could foresee,
I have found that whatever it lost me,
It could not deprive me of thee.

From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,
Thus much ı at least may recall,
It hath taught me that which ı most cherished
Deserved to be dearest of all:
In the desert a fountain is springing,
In the wide waste there still is a tree,
And a bird in the solitude singing,
Tears from the depth of some divine despair
Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
In looking on the happy autumn fields,
And thinking of the days that are no more.

Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
That brings our friends up from the underworld,
Sad as the last which reddens over one
That sinks with all we love below the verge;
So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds
To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
On lips that are for others; deep as love,
Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
A sword of metal keene!
Al else to noble heartes is drosse-
Al else on earth is meane.
The neighynge of the war-horse prowde.
The rowleing of the drum,
The clangor of the trumpet lowde-
Be soundes from heaven that come.
And oh! The thundering presse of knightes,
When as their war-cryes welle,
May tole from heaven an angel bright,
And rowse a fiend from hell,
Then mounte! Then mounte, brave gallants all,
And don your helmes amaine,
Deathe's couriers, fame and honor, call
Us to the field againe.
No shrewish teares shall fill your eye
When the sword-hilt's in our hand,-
Heart-whole we'll part, and no whit sighe
For the fayrest of the land;
Let piping swaine, and craven wight,
Thus weepe and puling crye,
Our business is like men to fight,
And hero-like to die!
By that heaven that bends above us-by that god we both adore,
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if within the distant aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore-
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore."
On the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted-nevermore!

Or the least boughs rustleling,
By a daisy whose leaves spread,
Shut when titan goes to bed,
Or a shady bush or tree,
She could more infuse in me
Than all nature's beauties con
In some other wiser man.
By her help ı also now
Make this churlish place allow
Something that may sweeten gladness
In the very gall of sadness-
The dull loneness, the black shade,
That these hanging vaults have made
The strange music of the waves
Beating on these hollow caves,
This black den which rocks emboss,
Overgrown with eldest moss,
The rude portals that give light
More to terror than delight,
This my chamber of neglect
Walled about with disrespect;
From all these and this dull air
A fit object for despair,
She hath taught me by her might
To draw comfort and delight.
'Twas on those little silver feet,
With what a pretty skipping grace
It oft would challenge me the race,
And when't had left me far away
'Twould stay, and run again, and stay;
For it was nimbler much than hinds,
And trod as if on the four winds.
I have a garden of my own,
But so with roses overgrown,
And lilies, that you would it guess
To be a little wilderness;
And all the spring-time of the year
It only loved to be there.
Among the beds of lilies ı
Have sought it oft where it should lie,
Yet could not, till itself would rise,
Find it, although before mine eyes.
For in the flaxen lilies shade
It like a bank of lilies laid;
Upon the roses it would feed
Until its lips even seemed to bleed,
And then to me 'twould boldly trip,
And print those roses on my lip,
But all its chief delight was still
With roses thus itself to fill,
And its pure virgin limbs to fold
In whitest sheets of lilies cold,
Had it lived long, it would have been
