# 📜 American Poetry Generator 

An AI to emulate American poets using GPT-2 and NLTK based on text input. A memorial website frond-end of output poems
  
## 🏫 About 
 
 The aim of this project is to analyze the style that artificial intelligence follows when it tries to imitate certain American poets. This code, which is currently based on Python3 and NLTK, will also take outputs from OpenAI and GPT-2 and analyze them in the future.
 ## 🚀 Usage
  Python 3 is required to run the poetry generator. The default inputpoems.txt file in the same directory contains all of Edgar Allen Poe's poems and will be used to generate a poem. 
  ```sh
python3 generate.py
```
  Alternatively, you can enter any book's worth of text here. Based on your computer's processing power and input length, this process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes.
